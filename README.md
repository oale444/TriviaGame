# TriviaGame
A fun trivia game with 16 questions that tests your continental knowledge.

I used html, bootstrap, css, and jQuery. 

# Rules
Click begin quiz to start. 
You will have 30 secs to answer multiple choices of 4.
There will be a little bit of a duration after every question before it moves on to the next question. BE PATIENT!
An alert box will notify you if you ran out of time.
Correct answer will display immediately after you chose an answer or timed out.
At the end of the quiz your stats of how many you got correct/incorrect or unanswered will display.

Unhappy with results?
